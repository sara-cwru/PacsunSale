# PacsunSale
Organizes all sale items from Pacsun Website through web scraping by either greatest percent saved or greatest price difference.

In the directory that the project is in, run php -S localhost:8000 in terminal. Then in your brower run http://localhost:8000/sales.php

<h2> Potential Updates </h2>
Currently everytime the user selects which view they want to see the sale items, the program goes through all the sale items each time. What would be more efficient is to save those items in a hashmap so that it doesn't have to spend the time going through each time the user selects a view.
